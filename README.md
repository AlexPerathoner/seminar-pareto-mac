The simplest security is the most important. 80% of hacks are caused by 20% of common preventable mistakes. Pareto Security is a Menu Bar app that quietly runs in the background and reminds you if you forget to enable your firewall, turn on disk encryption and perform similar basic security hygiene tasks.

Download the latest release from https://github.com/ParetoSecurity/pareto-mac/releases. If you see `You do not have permission to open application "Pareto Security"`, try running `chmod +x /Applications/Pareto\ Security.app/Contents/MacOS/*` inside a Terminal. We're pending approval for the App Store, when that is done, this will no longer be needed.
